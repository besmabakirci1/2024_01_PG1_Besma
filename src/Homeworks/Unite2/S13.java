//(Financial application: compound value)
// Suppose you save $100 each month into a savings account with the annual interest rate 5%.
// Thus, the monthly interest rate is 0.05/12 = 0.00417. After the first month, the value in the accoun becomes
//100 * (1 + 0.00417) = 100.417
//After the second month, the value in the account becomes
//(100 + 100.417) * (1 + 0.00417) = 201.252
//After the third month, the value in the account becomes
//(100 + 201.252) * (1 + 0.00417) = 302.507 and so on.
//Write a program that prompts the user to enter a monthly saving amount and displays the account value after the sixth month.
// (In Exercise 5.30, you will use a loop to simplify the code and display the account value for any month.)
//Enter the monthly saving amount: 100-> "Enter"
//After the sixth month, the account value is $608.81
