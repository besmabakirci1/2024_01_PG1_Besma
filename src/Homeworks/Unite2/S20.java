// (Financial application: calculate interest)
// If you know the balance and the annual percentage interest rate, you can compute the interest on the next monthly payment
// by using the following formula:
//interest = balance * (annualInterestRate/1200)
//Write a program that reads the balance and the annual percentage interest rate and displays the interest for the next month.
// Here is a sample run:
//Enter balance and interest rate (e.g., 3 for 3%): 1000 3.5-> "Enter"
//The interest is 2.91667
