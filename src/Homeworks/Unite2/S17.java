//(Science: wind-chill temperature)
// How cold is it outside? The temperature alone is not enough to provide the answer.
// Other factors including wind speed, relative humidity, and sunshine play important roles in determining coldness outside.
//In 2001, the National Weather Service (NWS) implemented the new wind-chill temperature to measure the coldness using temperature and wind speed.
// The formula is:
// twc =35.74 +0.6215×ta −35.75×(v^0.16) +0.4275×ta×(v^0.16)
//Where "ta" is the outside temperature measured in degrees Fahrenheit and "v" is the speed measured in miles per hour. "twc" is the wind-chill temperature.
// The formula cannot be used for wind speeds below 2 mph or temperatures below -58 oF or above 41oF.
//Write a program that prompts the user to enter a temperature between -58 oF and 41oF and a wind speed greater than or equal to 2
// and displays the wind-chill temperature. Use Math.pow(a, b) to compute v0.16.
// Here is a sample run:
// Enter the temperature in Fahrenheit between -58°F and 41°F: 5.3-> "Enter"
//Enter the wind speed (>=2) in miles per hour: 6-> "Enter"
//The wind chill index is -5.56707
