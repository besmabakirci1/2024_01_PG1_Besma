//(Sum the digits in an integer)
// Write a program that reads an integer between 0 and 1000 and adds all the digits in the integer.
// For example, if an integer is 932, the sum of all its digits is 14.
//Hint: Use the % operator to extract digits, and use the / operator to remove the extracted digit.
// For instance, 932 % 10 = 2 and 932 / 10 = 93.
//Here is a sample run:
// Enter a number between 0 and 1000: 999-> "Enter"
//The sum of the digits is 27
