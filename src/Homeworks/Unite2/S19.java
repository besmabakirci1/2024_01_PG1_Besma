// (Geometry: area of a triangle)
// Write a program that prompts the user to enter three points (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3) of a triangle and displays its area.
//The formula for computing the area of a triangle is:
//s = (side1 + side2 + side3)/2;
//area = âˆš(s(s - side1)(s - side2)(s - side3))
//Here is a sample run:
//Enter three points for a triangle: 1.5 -3.4 4.6 5 9.5 -3.4 -> "Enter"
//The area of the triangle is 33.6
