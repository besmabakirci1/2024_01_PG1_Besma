//(Physics: finding runway length)
// Given an airplaneâ€™s acceleration a and take-off speed v,
// you can compute the minimum runway length needed for an airplane to take off
// using the following formula: length = v^2/2a
//Write a program that prompts the user to enter v in meters/second (m/s)
// and the acceleration a in meters/second squared (m/s2), and displays the minimum run-way length.
// Here is a sample run:
//Enter speed and acceleration: 60 3.5-> "Enter"
//The minimum runway length for this airplane is 514.286
