//(Financial application: calculate future investment value)
// Write a program that reads in investment amount, annual interest rate, and number of years,
// and displays the future investment value using the following formula:

//futureInvestmentValue = investmentAmount * (1 + monthlyInterestRate)numberOfYears*12
//For example, if you enter amount 1000, annual interest rate 3.25%, and number of years 1,
// the future investment value is 1032.98.
//Here is a sample run:
//Enter investment amount: 1000.56-> "Enter"
//Enter annual interest rate in percentage: 4.25-> "Enter"
//Enter number of years: 1-> "Enter"
//Accumulated value is $1043.92
