// (Geometry: Distance of Two Points)
// This program calculates the distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) entered by the user.
// The distance formula is √((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2).
// Math.pow(a, 0.5) is used to compute the square root of a (√a).
//Enter x1 and y1: 1.5 -3.4-> "Enter"
//Enter x2 and y2: 4 5-> "Enter"
//The distance between the two points is 8.764131445842194
