//(Financial application: calculate tips)
//Write a program that reads the subtotal and the gratuity rate, then computes the gratuity and total.
// For example: if the user enters 10 for subtotal and 15% for gratuity rate, the program displays $1.5 as gratuity and $11.5 as total.
// Here is a sample run:
//Enter the subtotal and a gratuity rate: 10 15-> "Enter"
//The gratuity is $1.5 and total is $11.5
