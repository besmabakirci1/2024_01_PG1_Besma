// (Algebra: solve 2 * 2 linear equations)
// A linear equation can be solved using Cramer’s rule given in Programming Exercise 1.13.
// Write a program that prompts the user to enter a, b, c, d, e, and f and displays the result.
// If ad - bc is 0, report that “The equation has no solution.”
// Programming Exercises 109
// Enter a, b, c, d, e, f: 9.0 4.0 3.0 -5.0 -6.0 -21.0 -> "Enter"
// x is -2.0 and y is 3.0
// Enter a, b, c, d, e, f: 1.0 2.0 2.0 4.0 4.0 5.0 -> "Enter"
// The equation has no solution
