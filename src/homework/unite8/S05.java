// (Algebra: add two matrices)
// Write a method to add two matrices. The header of the method is as follows:
// public static double[][] addMatrix(double[][] a, double[][] b)
// In order to be added, the two matrices must have the same dimensions and the same or compatible types of elements.
// Let c be the resulting matrix. Each element cij is aij + bij.
 /* For example, for two 3 * 3 matrices a and b, c is
   Matris A:           Matris B:           Toplam C:
   [a11  a12  a13]  +  [b11  b12  b13]  =  [a11 + b11  a12 + b12  a13 + b13]
   [a21  a22  a23]     [b21  b22  b23]     [a21 + b21  a22 + b22  a23 + b23]
   [a31  a32  a33]     [b31  b32  b33]     [a31 + b31  a32 + b32  a33 + b33]

/* Write a test program that prompts the user to enter two 3 * 3 matrices and displays their sum.
    Here is a sample run:
   Enter matrix1: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
   Enter matrix2: 0 2 4 1 4.5 2.2 1.1 4.3 5.2

   The matrices are added as follows:

   Matrix1:               Matrix2:               Sum:
   [1.0 2.0 3.0]    +    [0.0 2.0 4.0]    =    [1.0 4.0 7.0]
   [4.0 5.0 6.0]         [1.0 4.5 2.2]         [5.0 9.5 8.2]
   [7.0 8.0 9.0]         [1.1 4.3 5.2]         [8.1 12.3 14.2]
