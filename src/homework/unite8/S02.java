//(Sum the major diagonal in a matrix)
// Write a method that sums all the numbers in the major diagonal in an n * n matrix of double values using the following header:
//public static double sumMajorDiagonal(double[][] m)
//Write a test program that reads a 4-by-4 matrix and displays the sum of all its
//elements on the major diagonal. Here is a sample run:
// Enter a 4-by-4 matrix row by row:
// 1 2 3 4.0
// 5 6.5 7 8
// 9 10 11 12
// 13 14 15 16
// Sum of the elements in the major diagonal is 34.5
