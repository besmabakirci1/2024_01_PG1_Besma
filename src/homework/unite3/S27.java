// (Geometry: points in triangle?)
// Suppose a right triangle is placed in a plane as shown below. The right-angle point is placed at (0, 0),
// and the other two points are placed at (200, 0), and (0, 100).
// Write a program that prompts the user to enter a point with x- and y-coordinates and determines whether the point is inside the triangle.
// Here are the sample runs:
// note: Please look at the book for the graph
// Enter a point's x- and y-coordinates: 100.5 25.5-> "Enter"
// The point is in the triangle
// Enter a point's x- and y-coordinates: 100.5 50.5-> "Enter"
// The point is not in the triangle
