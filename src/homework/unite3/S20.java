// (Science: wind-chill temperature)
// Programming Exercise 2.17 gives a formula to compute the wind-chill temperature.
// The formula is valid for temperatures in the range between âˆ’58oF and 41oF and wind speed greater than or equal to 2.
// Write a program that prompts the user to enter a temperature and a wind speed.
// The program displays the wind-chill temperature if the input is valid;
// otherwise, it displays a message indicating whether the temperature and/or wind speed is invalid.
