// Write a program that prompts the user to enter an integer for today’s day of the week (Sunday is 0, Monday is 1, ..., and Saturday is 6).
// Also prompt the user to enter the number of days after today for a future day and display the future day of the week.
// Here is a sample run:

// Enter the number of days elapsed since today: 3 -> "Enter"
// Today is Monday and the future day is Thursday
// Enter today's day: 0 -> "Enter"
// Enter the number of days elapsed since today: 31 -> "Enter"
// Today is Sunday and the future day is Wednesday
