// (Geometry: point online segment)
// Programming Exercise 3.32 shows how to test whether a point is on an unbounded line.
// Revise Programming Exercise 3.32 to test whether a point is on a line segment.
// Write a program that prompts the user to enter the three points for p0, p1, and p2 and displays whether p2 is on the line segment from p0 to p1.
// Here are some sample runs:

// Enter three points for p0, p1, and p2: 1 1 2.5 2.5 1.5 1.5-> "Enter"
// (1.5, 1.5) is on the line segment from (1.0, 1.0) to (2.5, 2.5)

// Enter three points for p0, p1, and p2:  1 1 2 2 3.5 3.5-> "Enter"
// (3.5, 3.5) is not on the line segment from (1.0, 1.0) to (2.0, 2.0)
