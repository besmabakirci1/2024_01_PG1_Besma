// (Cost of shipping)
// A shipping company uses the following function to calculate the cost (in dollars) of shipping based on the weight of the package (in pounds).
// c(w) = { 3.5, if 0 < w <= 1
//      = { 5.5, if 1 < w <= 3
//      = { 8.5, if 3 < w <= 10
//      = { 10.5, if 10 < w <= 20
// Write a program that prompts the user to enter the weight of the package and display the shipping cost.
// If the weight is greater than 50, display a message “the package cannot be shipped.”
