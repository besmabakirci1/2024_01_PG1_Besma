// Write a program that plays the popular scissor-rock- paper game.
// (A scissor can cut a paper, a rock can knock a scissor, and a paper can wrap a rock.)
// The program randomly generates a number 0, 1, or 2 representing scissor, rock, and paper.
// The program prompts the user to enter a number 0, 1, or 2 and displays a message indicating whether
// the user or the computer wins, loses, or draws. Here are sample runs:
// Programming Exercises 111
