// (Geometry: point in a circle?)
// Write a program that prompts the user to enter a point (x, y) and checks whether
// the point is within the circle centered at (0, 0) with radius 10.
// For example, (4, 5) is inside the circle and (9, 9) is outside the circle, as shown in Figure 3.7a.
// (Hint: A point is in the circle if its distance to (0, 0) is less than or equal to 10.
// The formula for computing the distance is Math.sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2).
// Test your program to cover all cases.) Two sample runs are shown below.
// Enter year: (e.g., 2012): 2012
// Enter month: 1-12: 5
// Enter the day of the month: 1-31: 12
// Day of the week is Saturday
// Enter a point with two coordinates: 4 5-> "Enter"
// Point (4.0, 5.0) is in the circle
// Enter a point with two coordinates: 9 9-> "Enter"
// Point (9.0, 9.0) is not in the circle
