// (Financial: compare costs)
// Suppose you shop for rice in two different packages. You would like to write a program to compare the cost.
// The program prompts the user to enter the weight and price of the each package and displays the one with the better price.
// Here is a sample run:

// Enter weight and price for package 1: 50 24.59-> "Enter"
// Enter weight and price for package 2: 25 11.99-> "Enter"
// Package 2 has a better price.

// Enter weight and price for package 1: 50 25-> "Enter"
// Enter weight and price for package 2: 25 12.5-> "Enter"
// Two packages have the same price.
