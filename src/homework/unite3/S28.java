//(Geometry: two rectangles)
// Write a program that prompts the user to enter the center x-, y-coordinates, width, and height of two rectangles
// and determines whether the second rectangle is inside the first or overlaps with the first, as shown in Figure 3.9.
// Test your program to cover all cases.
//Here are the sample runs:

// Enter r1's center x-, y-coordinates, width, and height: 2.5 4 2.5 43-> "Enter"
// Enter r2's center x-, y-coordinates, width, and height: 1.5 5 0.5 3-> "Enter"
// r2 is inside r1

// Enter r1's center x-, y-coordinates, width, and height: 1 2 3 5.5-> "Enter"
// Enter r2's center x-, y-coordinates, width, and height: 3 4 4.5 5-> "Enter"
// r2 overlaps r1

// Enter r1's center x-, y-coordinates, width, and height: 1 2 3 3-> "Enter"
// Enter r2's center x-, y-coordinates, width, and height: 40 45 3 2 -> "Enter"
// r2 does not overlap r1
