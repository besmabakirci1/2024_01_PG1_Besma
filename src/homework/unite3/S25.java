//(Geometry: intersecting point)
// Two points on line 1 are given as (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) and on line 2 as (x3, y3) and (x4, y4), as shown in Figure 3.8a–b.
//The intersecting point of the two lines can be found by solving the following linear equation:
// x * (y1 -y2) - y * (x1 -x2) = x1 * (y1 -y2) - y1 * (x1 -x2)
// x * (y3 -y4) - y * (x3 -x4) = x3 * (y3 -y4) - y3 * (x3 -x4)
//This linear equation can be solved using Cramer’s rule (see Programming Exercise 3.3).
// If the equation has no solutions, the two lines are parallel (Figure 3.8c).
//Write a program that prompts the user to enter four points and displays the intersecting point.
