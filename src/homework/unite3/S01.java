//(Algebra: solve quadratic equations)
// The two roots of a quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 can be obtained using the following formula:
// Section 3.2
// r1 = -b + 2b2 - 4ac 2a
// and r2 = -b - 2b2 - 4ac 2a
// b2 - 4ac is called the discriminant of the quadratic equation.
// If it is positive, the equation has two real roots. If it is zero, the equation has one root. If it is negative, the equation has no real roots.
// Write a program that prompts the user to enter values for a, b, and c and displays the result based on the discriminant.
// If the discriminant is positive, display two roots. If the discriminant is 0, display one root.
// Otherwise, display “The equation has no real roots”.
// Note that you can use Math.pow(x, 0.5) to compute 2x. Here are some sample runs.
// Enter a, b, c: 1.0 3 1 -> "Enter"
// The equation has two roots -0.381966 and -2.61803
// Enter a, b, c: 1 2.0 1 -> "Enter"
// The equation has one root -1
// Enter a, b, c: 1 2 3 -> "Enter"
// The equation has no real roots
