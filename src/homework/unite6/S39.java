// (Geometry: point position)
// Programming Exercise 3.32 shows how to test whether a point is on the left side of a directed line, on the right, or on the same line. Write the methods with the following headers:
///** Return true if point (x2, y2) is on the left side of the
//*  directed line from (x0, y0) to (x1, y1) */
// public static boolean leftOfTheLine (double x0, double y0, double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2)
///** Return true if point (x2, y2) is on the same
//*  line from (x0, y0) to (x1, y1) */
// public static boolean onTheSameLine(double x0, double y0, double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2)
///** Return true if point (x2, y2) is on the
//*  line segment from (x0, y0) to (x1, y1) */
// public static boolean onTheLineSegment(double x0, double y0, double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2)
// Write a program that prompts the user to enter the three points for p0, p1, and p2
// and displays whether p2 is on the left of the line from p0 to p1, right, the same line, or on the line segment.
// Here are some sample runs:
// Enter three points for p0, p1, and p2: 1 1 2 2 1.5 1.5-> "Enter"
// (1.5, 1.5) is on the line segment from (1.0, 1.0) to (2.0, 2.0)

// Enter three points for p0, p1, and p2: 1 1 2 2 3 3-> "Enter"
// (3.0, 3.0) is on the same line from (1.0, 1.0) to (2.0, 2.0)

// Enter three points for p0, p1, and p2: 1 1 2 2 1 1.5-> "Enter"
// (1.0, 1.5) is on the left side of the line from (1.0, 1.0) to (2.0, 2.0)

// Enter three points for p0, p1, and p2: 1 1 2 2 1 -1-> "Enter"
// (1.0, -1.0) is on the right side of the line from (1.0, 1.0) to (2.0, 2.0)
