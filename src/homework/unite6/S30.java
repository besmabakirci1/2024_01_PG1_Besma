// (Game: craps)
// Craps is a popular dice game played in casinos.
// Write a program to play a variation of the game, as follows:
// Roll two dice. Each die has six faces representing values 1, 2, ..., and 6, respectively.
// Check the sum of the two dice. If the sum is 2, 3, or 12 (called craps), you lose;
// if the sum is 7 or 11 (called natural), you win; if the sum is another value
// (i.e., 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10), a point is established.
// Continue to roll the dice until either a 7 or the same point value is rolled.
// If 7 is rolled, you lose. Otherwise, you win.
// Your program acts as a single player. Here are some sample runs.
// You rolled 5 + 6 = 11
// You win
// You rolled 1 + 2 = 3
// You lose
