// (The MyTriangle class)
// Create a class named MyTriangle that contains the following two methods:
// /** Return true if the sum of any two sides is
//  *  greater than the third side. */
// public static boolean isValid(double side1, double side2, double side3)
// /** Return the area of the triangle. */
// public static double area(double side1, double side2, double side3)
// Write a test program that reads three sides for a triangle and computes the area if the input is valid.
// Otherwise, it displays that the input is invalid.
// The formula for computing the area of a triangle is given in Programming Exercise 2.19.
