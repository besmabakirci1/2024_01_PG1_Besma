// (Math: approximate the square root)
// There are several techniques for implementing the sqrt method in the Math class.
// One such technique is known as the Babylonian method.
// It approximates the square root of a number, n, by repeatedly performing a calculation using the following formula:
// nextGuess = (lastGuess + n / lastGuess) / 2
// When nextGuess and lastGuess are almost identical, nextGuess is the approximated square root.
// The initial guess can be any positive value (e.g., 1).
// This value will be the starting value for lastGuess.
// If the difference between nextGuess and lastGuess is less than a very small number,
// such as 0.0001, you can claim that nextGuess is the approximated square root of n.
// If not, next-Guess becomes lastGuess and the approximation process continues.
// Implement the following method that returns the square root of n.
// public static double sqrt(long n)
