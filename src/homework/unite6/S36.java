// (Geometry: area of a regular polygon)
// A regular polygon is an n-sided polygon in which all sides are of the same length
// and all angles have the same degree (i.e., the polygon is both equilateral and equiangular).
// The formula for computing the area of a regular polygon is
// Area = (n * Math.pow(s,2)) / 4 * tan(Math.PI / n)
// Write a method that returns the area of a regular polygon using the following header:
// public static double area(int n, double side)
// Write a main method that prompts the user to enter the number of sides and the
// side of a regular polygon and displays its area. Here is a sample run:
// Enter the number of sides: 5-> "Enter"
// Enter the side: 6.5-> "Enter"
// The area of the polygon is 72.69017017488385
