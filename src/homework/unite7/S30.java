//(Pattern recognition: consecutive four equal numbers)
// Write the following method that tests whether the array has four consecutive numbers with the same value.
// public static boolean isConsecutiveFour(int[] values)
// Write a test program that prompts the user to enter a series of integers and displays
// if the series contains four consecutive numbers with the same value.
// Your program should first prompt the user to enter the input sizeâ€”i.e.,
// the number of values in the series.
// Here are sample runs:
// Enter the number of values: 8 -> "Enter"
// Enter the values: 3 4 5 5 5 5 4 5 -> "Enter"
// The list has consecutive fours
// Enter the number of values: 9 -> "Enter"
// Enter the values: 3 4 5 5 6 5 5 4 5 -> "Enter"
// The list has no consecutive fours
