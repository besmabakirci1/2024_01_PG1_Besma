// (Revise selection sort)
// In Section 7.11, you used selection sort to sort an array.
// The selection-sort method repeatedly finds the smallest number in
// the current array and swaps it with the first.
// Rewrite this program by finding the largest number and swapping it with the last.
// Write a test program that reads in ten double numbers, invokes the method,
// and displays the sorted numbers.
