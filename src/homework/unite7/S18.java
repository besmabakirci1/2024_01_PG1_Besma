// (Bubble sort)
// Write a sort method that uses the bubble-sort algorithm.
// The bubble-sort algorithm makes several passes through the array.
// On each pass, successive neighboring pairs are compared.
// If a pair is not in order, its values are swapped; otherwise, the values remain unchanged.
// The technique is called a bubble sort or sinking sort because the smaller values gradually “bubble” their way to the top and the larger values “sink” to the bottom.
// Write a test program that reads in ten double numbers, invokes the method, and displays the sorted numbers.
