// (Game: hangman)
// Write a hangman game that randomly generates a word and prompts the user to guess one letter at a time,
// as shown in the sample run. Each letter in the word is displayed as an asterisk.
// When the user makes a correct guess, the actual letter is then displayed.
// When the user finishes a word, display the number of misses
// and ask the user whether to continue to play with another word.
// Declare an array to store words, as follows:
/*
      // Add any words you wish in this array
      String[] words = {"write", "that", ...};
 */
// (Guess) Enter a letter in word ******* > p -> "Enter"
// (Guess) Enter a letter in word p****** > r -> "Enter"
// (Guess) Enter a letter in word pr**r** > p -> "Enter"
//     p is already in the word
// (Guess) Enter a letter in word pr**r** > o -> "Enter"
// (Guess) Enter a letter in word pro*r** > g -> "Enter"
// (Guess) Enter a letter in word progr** > n -> "Enter"
//     n is not in the word
// (Guess) Enter a letter in word progr** > m -> "Enter"
// (Guess) Enter a letter in word progr*m > a -> "Enter"
// The word is program. You missed 1 time
// Do you want to guess another word? Enter y or n>
