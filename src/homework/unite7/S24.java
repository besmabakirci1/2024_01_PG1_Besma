// (Simulation: coupon collectorâ€™s problem)
// Coupon collector is a classic statistics problem with many practical applications.
// The problem is to pick objects from a set of objects repeatedly and find out how many picks are needed for all the
// objects to be picked at least once.
// A variation of the problem is to pick cards from a shuffled deck of 52 cards repeatedly
// and find out how many picks are needed before you see one of each suit.
// Assume a picked card is placed back in the deck before picking another.
// Write a program to simulate the number of picks needed to get four cards from each suit
// and display the four cards picked (it is possible a card may be picked twice).
// Here is a sample run of the program:
// Queen of Spades
// 5 of Clubs
// Queen of Hearts
// 4 of Diamonds
// Number of picks: 12
