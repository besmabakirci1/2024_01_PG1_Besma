// (Count occurrence of numbers)
// Write a program that reads the integers between 1 and 100 and counts the occurrences of each.
// Assume the input ends with 0.
// Here is a sample run of the program:
// Enter the integers between 1 and 100: 2 5 6 5 4 3 23 43 2 0 -> "Enter"
// 2 occurs 2 times
// 3 occurs 1 time
// 4 occurs 1 time
// 5 occurs 2 times
// 6 occurs 1 time
// 23 occurs 1 time
// 43 occurs 1 time
// Note that if a number occurs more than one time, the plural word “times” is used in the output.
