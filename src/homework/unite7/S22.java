// (Game: Eight Queens)
// The classic Eight Queens puzzle is to place eight queens on a chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other
// (i.e., no two queens are on the same row, same column, or same diagonal).
// There are many possible solutions. Write a program that displays one such solution.
// A sample output is shown below:
