// (Revise Listing 5.15, PrimeNumber.java)
// Listing 5.15 determines whether a number n is prime by checking whether 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ..., n/2 is a divisor.
// If a divisor is found, n is not prime. A more efficient approach is to check whether any of the prime numbers less than
// or equal to 2n can divide n evenly. If not, n is prime.
// Rewrite Listing 5.15 to display the first 50 prime numbers using this approach.
// You need to use an array to store the prime numbers and later use them to check whether they are possible divisors for n.
