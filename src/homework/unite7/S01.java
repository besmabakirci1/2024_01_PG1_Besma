// (Assign grades)
// Write a program that reads student scores, gets the best score, and then assigns grades based on the following scheme:
// Grade is A if score is >= best - 10
// Grade is B if score is >= best - 20;
// Grade is C if score is >= best - 30;
// Grade is D if score is >= best - 40;
// Grade is F otherwise.
// The program prompts the user to enter the total number of students, then prompts the user to enter all of the scores,
// and concludes by displaying the grades.
// Here is a sample run:
// Enter the number of students: 4 -> "Enter"
// Enter 4 scores: 40 55 70 58 -> "Enter"
// Student 0 score is 40 and grade is C
// Student 1 score is 55 and grade is B
// Student 2 score is 70 and grade is A
// Student 3 score is 58 and grade is B
