// (Game: locker puzzle)
// A school has 100 lockers and 100 students. All lockers are closed on the first day of school.
// As the students enter, the first student, denoted S1, opens every locker.
// Then the second student, S2, begins with the second locker, denoted L2, and closes every other locker.
// Student S3 begins with the third locker and changes every third locker
// (closes it if it was open, and opens it if it was closed).
// Student S4 begins with locker L4 and changes every fourth locker.
// Student S5 starts with L5 and changes every fifth locker, and so on,
// until student S100 changes L100.
// After all the students have passed through the building and changed the lockers, which lockers are open?
// Write a program to find your answer and display all open locker numbers separated by exactly one space.

// (Hint: Use an array of 100 Boolean elements,
// each of which indicates whether a locker is open (true) or closed (false).
// Initially, all lockers are closed.)
