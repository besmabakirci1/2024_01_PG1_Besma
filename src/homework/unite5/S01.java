// (Count positive and negative numbers and compute the average of numbers)
// Write a program that reads an unspecified number of integers,
// determines how many positive and negative values have been read,
// and computes the total and average of the input values (not counting zeros).
// Your program ends with the input 0. Display the average as a floating-point number.
// Here is a sample run:
// Enter an integer, the input ends if it is 0: 1 2 -1 3 0 -> "Enter"
// The number of positives is 3
// The number of negatives is 1
// The total is 5.0
// The average is 1.25
// Enter an integer, the input ends if it is 0: 0 -> "Enter"
// No numbers are entered except 0
