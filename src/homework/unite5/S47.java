// (Business: check ISBN-13)
// ISBN-13 is a new standard for indentifying books. It uses 13 digits d1d2d3d4d5d6d7d8d9d10d11d12d13.
// The last digit d13 is a checksum, which is calculated from the other digits using the following formula:
// 10-(d1 +3d2 +d3 +3d4 +d5 +3d6 +d7 +3d8 +d9 +3d10 +d11 +3d12) % 10 If the checksum is 10, replace it with 0.
// Your program should read the input as a string.
// Here are sample runs:
//Enter the first 12 digits of an ISBN-13 as a string: 978013213080
//The ISBN-13 number is 9780132130806
//Enter the first 12 digits of an ISBN-13 as a string: 978013213079
//The ISBN-13 number is 9780132130790
