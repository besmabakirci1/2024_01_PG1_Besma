//(Compute the greatest common divisor)
// Another solution for Listing 5.9 to find the greatest common divisor of two integers n1 and n2 is as follows:
// First find d to be the minimum of n1 and n2,
// then check whether d, d-1, d-2, ..., 2, or 1 is a divisor for both n1 and n2 in this order.
// The first such common divisor is the greatest common divisor for n1 and n2.
// Write a program that prompts the user to enter two positive integers and displays the gcd.
