// (Computer architecture: bit-level operations)
// A short value is stored in 16 bits. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a short integer
// and displays the 16 bits for the integer.
// Here are sample runs:
// Enter an integer: 5-> "Enter"
// The bits are 0000000000000101
// Enter an integer: -5-> "Enter"
// The bits are 1111111111111011
//(Hint: You need to use the bitwise right shift operator (>>) and the bitwise AND operator (&),
// which are covered in Appendix G, Bitwise Operations.)
