// (Statistics: compute mean and standard deviation)
// In business applications, you are often asked to compute the mean and standard deviation of data.
// The mean is simply the average of the numbers. The standard deviation is a statistic that tells
// you how tightly all the various data are clustered around the mean in a set of data.
// For example, what is the average age of the students in a class? How close are the ages?
// If all the students are the same age, the deviation is 0.
// Write a program that prompts the user to enter ten numbers,
// and displays the mean and standard deviations of these numbers using the following formula:
// for formula check the book
// Enter ten numbers: 1 2 3 4.5 5.6 6 7 8 9 10
//The mean is 5.61
//The standard deviation is 2.99794
