//(Financial application: compound value)
// Suppose you save $100 each month into a savings account with the annual interest rate 5%.
// So, the monthly interest rate is 0.05 / 12 = 0.00417. After the first month, the value in the account becomes
//  100 * (1 + 0.00417) = 100.417
//After the second month, the value in the account becomes
//  (100 + 100.417) * (1 + 0.00417) = 201.252
//After the third month, the value in the account becomes
//  (100 + 201.252) * (1 + 0.00417) = 302.507
// and so on.
//Write a program that prompts the user to enter an amount (e.g., 100), the annual interest rate (e.g., 5),
// and the number of months (e.g., 6) and displays the amount in the savings account after the given month.
