// (Geometry: area of a hexagon)
// The area of a hexagon can be computed using the following formula (s is the length of a side):
// Area = (6 * (s^2)) / 4 * tan(Math.PI / 6)
// Write a program that prompts the user to enter the side of a hexagon and displays its area.
// Here is a sample run:
// Enter the side: 5.5-> "Enter"
// The area of the hexagon is 78.59
