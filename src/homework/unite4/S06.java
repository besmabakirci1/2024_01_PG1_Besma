//(Random points on a circle)
// Write a program that generates three random points on a circle centered at (0, 0) with radius 40
// and display three angles in a triangle formed by these three points, as shown in Figure 4.7a.
// (Hint: Generate a random angle (alfa) in radians between 0 and 2p,
// as shown in Figure 4.7b and the point determined by this angle is (r*cos(a), r*sin(a)).)
