// (Geometry: area of a pentagon)
// Write a program that prompts the user to enter the length from the center of a pentagon to a vertex and computes
// the area of the pentagon, as shown in the following figure.
// The formula for computing the area of a pentagon is Area = (5 * (s^2)) / 4 * tan(Math.PI / 5)
//s is the length of a side. The side can be computed using the formula s = 2 * r * sin(Math.PI / 5),
//where r is the length from the center of a pentagon to a vertex. Round up two digits after the decimal point.
// Here is a sample run:
// Enter the length from the center to a vertex: 5.5-> "Enter"
// The area of the pentagon is 71.92
