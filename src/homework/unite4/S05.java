// (Geometry: area of a regular polygon)
// A regular polygon is an n-sided polygon in which all sides are of the same length and all angles have the same degree
// (i.e., the polygon is both equilateral and equiangular).
// The formula for computing the area of a regular polygon is
// Area = (n*(s^2)) / 4 * tan(Math.PI / n)
// Here, s is the length of a side.
// Write a program that prompts the user to enter the number of sides and their length of a regular polygon and displays its area.
// Here is a sample run:
// Enter the number of sides: 5-> "Enter"
// Enter the side: 6.5-> "Enter"
// The area of the polygon is 74.69017017488385
