//(Compute the volume of a cylinder)
// Write a program that reads in the radius and length of a cylinder and computes the area and volume using the following formulas:
//area = radius * radius * p
//volume = area * length
//Here is a sample run:
//Enter the radius and length of a cylinder: 5.5 12-> "Enter"
//The area is 95.0331
//The volume is 1140.4
